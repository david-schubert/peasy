# Peasy - open by default

Peasy is a simple, clean, open-by-default way to publish to the web. Peasy is open-source software, and it's goal is to be as easy to use as Medium, but hosted on your own domain.

Most importantly, Peasy promotes open content by default. Instead of building things from scratch or from stock templates, Peasy invites you to clone an existing site. Want to make a syllabus? Want to build a course website? an online textbook? Find one that already exists and remix it to suit your needs.

This project is built on top of some amazing projects:

- [Medium Editor](https://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/) for a pleasant writing experience, editing directly on the page.  
- [Medium Editor Insert](http://linkesch.com/medium-editor-insert-plugin/) for easy embedding of media like pictures and videos.  
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for simple styling.  
- And of course, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (client-side), and PHP (server-side, and shared hosting compatible).
