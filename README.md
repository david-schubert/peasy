# Peasy - open by default

Peasy is a simple, clean, open-by-default way to publish to the web. Peasy is open-source software, and it's goal is to be an easy way to build a website hosted on your own domain.

For more project details and full documentation, visit [https://peasy.pushpullfork.com/](https://peasy.pushpullfork.com/).

This project is built on top of some amazing projects:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for simple styling.  
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for the button icons in Medium Editor.  
- And of course, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (client-side), and PHP (server-side, and shared hosting compatible).  

And it pairs well with [CleanWrite](http://pushpullfork.com/cleanwrite), a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor for simple HTML pages. CleanWrite is built on top of [Medium Editor](https://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/), a JavsScript library that allows for super clean writing and editing, directly on the page.
